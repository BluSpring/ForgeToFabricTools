# SRG Mapper

This is a tool used for remapping decompiled Forge mods from the Forge intermediary names, SRG, to the official Mojang mappings. This is especially helpful if the mod is closed source, and you wish to port the mod over to Fabric, or to update the mod.

However, I must warn you, **do not upload the mod publicly, unless you have explicit permission from the creator**. If the mod is closed source, it is most likely licensed as ARR, and I am not responsible for if you run into any legal issues for doing so. I highly recommend you *only* use the modified mod (modified modification? wow) privately, as you will very likely run into legal issues.
